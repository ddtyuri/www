        	<h3>Introduction of Bluestone</h3>
            <p>
Bluestone is the most widely distributed lake basin generated grey or off-white sedimentary rock in the crust (about 15% of the lithosphere), which is the most important componenting rock in the carbonate rocks. Bluestone is the raw material of lime. Besides, blues tone is also mined for gravel, large sand by gravel plant. Gravel is used as a cement composition. Large sand become a necessity to buildings. Bluestoneâ€™s  main ingredient is calcium carbonate, which is radiationless and pollution-free, so bluestone made slate product, stone carving product are green also.			</p>
        	<h3>Technological Process of Bluestone</h3>
            <p>
Bluestone is relatively soft. After mined, it usually crushed by jaw crusher and impact crusher for their features of high crushing ratio, stable operating and so on, which is favored by the users.Bluestone crushing product line: stone blasted down from mountains, and that less than 1020mm will be conveyed into vibrating feeder by dump truck, then be conveyed into jaw crusher gradually for first step crushing. The crushed stone are around 150mm-300mm, which will be feeded into impact crusher or cone crusher by vibrating feeder for second step crushing. Then the crushed stone will be sreened by circular vibrating screen. Material that bigger than finished material will be returned to impact crusher or cone crusher again, and the finished material will be transported to the finished product area by conveyor belt. The bluestone crusher produced by Vipeak Heavy Industry are designed by combing the the current international top technology, with the feature of advanced equipment, smooth operation, high crushing ratio, uniform particle size of the material, simple structure, reliable performance, easy maintenance, economic operation. Wearable pieces are all adopted excellent manganese steel castings. Combining advanced technology and customer feedback and base on years of crushing machine industry, the company leading developed and producted large and medium size bluestone crusher has been at the absolute leading level in the large and medium size crusher market with constant innovation and improvement.
			</p>			
        	<h3>Application Fields of Bluestone</h3>
            <p>
The crusher and sand making machine processed aggregate of bluestone is widely used in a variety of areas like highway, railway, rural roads, building sand and so on. bluestone is an ideal material in the construction industry. Most of the bluestone are light grey thick oolitic rock and thick oolitic rock and leopard limestone with the advantages of water absorbing, heat absorbing, heat preservating, antiskid, moistureproof, chill-proof, antifreezing and so on, which can be applied to municipal construction, landscaping, units and home decoration.			</p>
