        	<h3>Introduction of Bentonite</h3>
            <p>
Bentonite is wet clay ore, its main element is montmorillonite of which chemical component is (Al2,Mg3) Si4O10 OH2?nH20, because of its special characters like swell property, caking property, adsorbability, catalytic, thixotropy, suspension property, bentonite is widely applied in many industries. Bentonite is applied in 100 industries of 24 areas and 300 products are involved, called omnipotent soil.Bentonite
			</p>
        	<h3>Technological Process of Bentonite</h3>
            <p>
Bentonite's application is getting wider, therefore, the requirement on bentonite is increased, and grinding machine is indispensable in powder making process. Bentonite has different physical property, bentonite's characters have been expanded in many areas, and there will be more requirements on powder grinding mill. Efficiency improvement of grinding machine is key part for mineral resources conservation and low carbon energy. How to choose suitable bentonite powder grinding machine according to different fineness? When final size is in the range of 100 to 300 mesh, raymond mill would be appropriate machine; when final size is above 800 mesh, superfine mill should be selected. Superfine grinding machine is high effictive and low energy consumption, and concerned about its low maintenance ratio, superfine grinding machine is the best bentonite grinding machine. Winnermac bentonite grinding machine and production line's capacity is higher than other machinery by 10%, fully closed system, non-pollution, machine reaches to national standard, and Winnermac has provided technical support for hundreds of manufacturers.
			</p>			
        	<h3>Application Fields of Bentonite</h3>
            <p>
Bentonite has wide application range, its quality and application depend on montmorillonite content and attribute type and crystal chemical characteristics. Bentonite has adsorbability and cation exchange performance, it can reduce the toxin of cooking oil, purify water gasoline and kerosene; it could be used in drilling fluid and inflaming retarding (suspension outfired by good swell performance and suspension and dispersion performance. And it could be padding in the paper making industry, adhesive force, covering power and water resistence of coating could be improved. It could replace starch in textile industry by its good binding power. In addition, bentonite could be used as waterproof material, for example, geosynthetic clay liner and bentomate panel.
